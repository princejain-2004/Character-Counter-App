# Character-Counter-App
The Character Counter project is a simple yet powerful web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to create a real-time character count tool that allows users to track the number of characters they've typed into a text input field or textarea.
Key Features:

Real-time Character Count: As users type in the input field, the character count updates dynamically in real time.

Maximum Character Limit: The app can display a maximum character limit (e.g., 200 characters), and the user is notified when they are nearing the limit.

Customizable Design: Using CSS, the interface can be styled to fit the needs of any website or application, with options to change fonts, colors, and layout.

User Feedback: Visual indicators, such as changing the color of the counter when the limit is approached or exceeded, help provide clear feedback to the user.

Responsive Design: The project is built to be fully responsive, making it usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used:

HTML for the structure and layout of the page.

CSS for styling and visual enhancements.

JavaScript for dynamic functionality, including the live character count and character limit logic.

This project can be used in various applications like creating social media posts, text-based feedback forms, or even as a feature in a word processor. The main goal is to ensure a smooth and user-friendly experience with easy-to-understand feedback as users input their text.

Objective:

To learn how to manipulate DOM elements using JavaScript.

To apply CSS for styling a functional web tool.

To practice building interactive web applications with a focus on usability and performance.
